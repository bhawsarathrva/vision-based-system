## Vision-Based Object Detection Model
Overview
This repository contains a vision-based object detection model designed to identify and classify objects in images or video streams. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the model provides accurate and real-time object detection for a variety of applications, including surveillance, autonomous systems, and industrial automation.

### Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Supports live detection using a camera or video feed.
Customizable Classes: Easily train the model for specific object categories.
Pre-Trained Weights: Includes pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN for quick deployment.
High Accuracy: Achieves state-of-the-art performance using deep neural networks.
Scalable: Adaptable for edge devices or high-performance computing systems.
### Requirements
Python 3.7 or later
### Key Libraries:
TensorFlow / PyTorch
